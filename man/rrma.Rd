\title{Robust random-effect meta-regression with dependent effect sizes}
\usage{
  rrma(formula, data, study_id, var_eff_size, rho)
}
\arguments{
  \item{formula}{The meta-regression formula of the form
  \code{y ~ x1 + x2...}, where \code{y} is the effect size.
  An intercept only meta-analysis can be performed with
  \code{y ~ 1}. The intercept can be excluded with \code{y
  ~ -1 + x1 + x2 ...}}

  \item{data}{The input data frame.}

  \item{study_id}{The study IDs. Can be in any form
  (character, numeric, factor). Will be converted to factor
  and then numeric form internally.}

  \item{var_eff_size}{The variance on each effect size.}

  \item{rho}{The assumed correlation between effect sizes
  of the same study including correlation induced by the
  random effects. Hedges et al. (2010) suggest conducting a
  sensitivity analysis on \code{rho}.}
}
\value{
  A list with the robust covariance matrix, the Qe
  statistic, the tau_sq estimate (variance between
  studies), a data frame of the robust coefficient
  estimates and standard errors, and a number of
  diagnostics and input values.
}
\description{
  \code{rrma} returns robust variance estimates from random
  effect meta-regression with dependent effect-size
  estimates.
}
\details{
  This is an implementation based on the \code{robust.se}
  function from Hedges et al. (2010).

data(broad)
(m <- rrma(formula = lnorReg ~ d18OresidualMean.cent, data =
broad, study_id = study.ID, var_eff = vlnorReg, rho = 0.5))
}

  Main body of code is from the appendix of Hedges et al.
  (2010) and written by the paper authors. Code adapted to
  an R package with a formula interface and various
  convenience functions by Sean Anderson and Jarrett
  Byrnes.
