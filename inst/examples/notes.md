The typical JSS paper will have a section explaining the statistical technique, a section explaining the code, a section with the actual code, and a section with examples. All sections will be made browsable as well as downloadable. The papers and code should be accessible to a broad community of practitioners, teachers, and researchers in the field of statistics.

If the statistical technique has been published elsewhere, a short introduction with references is usually sufficient. To assess the software part, its source code must be submitted along with information on how to replicate the results from the manuscript.

All submissions are electronic. Submissions should go to editor@jstatsoft.org. 

Papers must be written in LaTeX using the JSS style files and must be submitted as pdfs.

Introduction

existing meta-– analysis software for R
 ones that deal with dependency in effect sizes: metadep,STATA  package
 metafor
 
  The problem of dependency in effect sizes
  the three ways of dealing it
  
how rrma deals with this

 describe the different kinds of diagnostic plots
 
 Use an example with enough studies some dependency and where it matters if we account for dependency
 
  describe the formula interface, for example intercept, only meta-regression with covariates,  and meta-regression without an intercept
  
   model selection?
  
  Show the various plots
  –  forest plot
  – prediction with confidence intervals plot
  – funnel plot
